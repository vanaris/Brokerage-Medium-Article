# Brokerage-Medium-Article

This is sample code adapted from a previous Insurance Brokerage firm use case.

## Current State

The repository is currently incomplete and contains the following limitations:

- Missing config.ini files
- Incomplete Docker files
- Missing AWS services account setup and CLI commands
- Incomplete documentation and explanations
- Missing requirements.txt file
- Missing ETL code
- Missing CI/CD code
- Missing deployment code
- Missing fraud detection code

## Purpose

This code is designed as an outline and descriptive code. The goal is to use these to create a Medium article as a guide for others. It is for giving insight and is not currently designed to function. The code is not standalone and requires paid services through AWS. This is not how the code existed in the actual project; it has been adapted to be much simpler.
