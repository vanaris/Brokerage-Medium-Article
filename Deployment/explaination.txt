To deploy the model, you can use Amazon SageMaker, which is a fully-managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.


Creating a SageMaker Model using the trained ALS model: 

Create a Dockerfile

build the Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR: 

$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-west-2)

docker build -t insurance-predict .
docker tag insurance-predict:latest your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-ecr-repo-name:latest
docker push your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-ecr-repo-name:latest

Create a SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions:
Create a SageMaker model using the Docker image from Amazon ECR.
Create an endpoint configuration with the model.
